Well, I suppose if you are reading this you survived!

The ship malfunctioned when we were looking for Wyrm Cubes. I had to put you in stasis and send you down to the surface. 

I don't know how long you've been down here, but I hope you're well.

Look out for the supply drops I sent your way. They should have some supplies to help you...

Find the wyrm cubes. That's right. You gotta find 'em still. I know we were going to have a whole team down there to help but now we're dunna need 'em more than ever. 

I hate to say it but we're going to have to waste this *Wyrm Wish* on getting out of here. It's our only chance.

So... good luck?

Here are some tips to get started:
-- Look for the supply drops I sent your way.
---- They might have got stuck in trees or something.
---- They glow at night, so look for the light.
-- Avoid dangerous mobs. We need you alive.
-- Use the Wyrm Radar to find the wyrm cubes.
-- Don't die. Seriously. We need you alive.


Oh BTW, I detected a few hostile life forms in the area. They seem to be looking for the Wyrm Cubes as well. 

That Wyrm Radar you have puts off a lot of radiation, hopefully that doesn't atract anyone...

Well, one thing we know for sure is if you see them, run away. They're not friendly.

//// Overview
This is the standard issue Wyrm Cube guide. However I (Rover) have added a few notes to help you out since we're in a weird spot this time. 

//// Wyrm Radar 
The Wyrm Radar is a device that you carry with you. It will help you find the Wyrm Cubes. It works by detecting the radiation emitted by the cubes.

When you use the Wyrm Radar, it will draw a trail pointing toward the nearest Wyrm Cube. It also shows you the distance to the cube at the top of your HUD.

WARNING: We have reason to believe that an using the Wyrm Radar can attract monsters. Use with caution.

//// Supply Drops
The supply drops are crates that I sent down to the surface. They contain supplies to help you survive.

When you find a supply drop, you can open it by right clicking on it. 

NOTE: This time these will have a random selection of supplies. I just sent down whatever I could find.

//// Orientation
Aside from pointing out the direction of the Wyrm Cubes, you might find yourself needing to know your own location. 

The Wyrm GPS will show you your coordinates in the top of your HUD when used. It also allows you to use the minimap with the 'Minimap' key.

The binoculars are a great way to get a better view of the area. You can use them to zoom in on distant objects. 

NOTE: Neither the Wyrm GPS or the binoculars need to be your active item in order to provide their basic capabilities.

//// Capsules
Capsules are a high tech storage device that can store items or entire stuructures.

You should have been suppplied with a wide variety of capsules in your supply drops. 

To use an item of vehicle capsule, simply right click on the ground where you want to place it.

To use a structure capsule, stand in the location you want to center the structure and right click.

NOTE: You were not supplied with a "wide variety" of capsules. I tried to send down all the capsules I could find. 

//// Vehicles
The vehicles are a great way to get around the surface. They are fast and can sometimes carry a lot of items.

You should have been supplied with a few vehicle capsules in your supply drops.

To use a vehicle capsule, simply right click on the ground where you want to place it.

Right click on the vehicle to enter it. 

Different vehicles have different controls.

Right click on it to enter the hidroplane.

Right click again to start the engine. Here you can also access other information about the plane.
