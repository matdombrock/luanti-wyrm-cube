Well, I suppose if you are reading this you survived!

The ship malfunctioned when we were looking for Wyrm Cubes. I had to put you in stasis and send you down to the surface. 

I don't know how long you've been down here, but I hope you're well.

Look out for the supply drops I sent your way. They should have some supplies to help you...

Find the wyrm cubes. That's right. You gotta find 'em still. I know we were going to have a whole team down there to help but now we're dunna need 'em more than ever. 

I hate to say it but we're going to have to waste this *Wyrm Wish* on getting out of here. It's our only chance.

So... good luck?

Here are some tips to get started:
-- Look for the supply drops I sent your way.
---- They might have got stuck in trees or something.
---- They glow at night, so look for the light.
-- Avoid dangerous mobs. We need you alive.
-- Use the Wyrm Radar to find the wyrm cubes.
-- Don't die. Seriously. We need you alive.


Oh BTW, I detected a few hostile life forms in the area. They seem to be looking for the Wyrm Cubes as well. 

That Wyrm Radar you have puts off a lot of radiation, hopefully that doesn't atract anyone...

Well, one thing we know for sure is if you see them, run away. They're not friendly.
